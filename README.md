# Absolute-Justice
An Interactive Platform for the common man to interact with the police force.
The current Police System needs an interactive stage where people can get regular updates about the current  police activities and status 
about their cases and the criminals they filed case on.
Absolute Justice  is the bridge between that gap.It provides the general public the facility to
1.File Complaints Online.
2.See the Missing Persons in a certain District
3.Criminals in a particular district 
4.Police force of a district
5.A Police login with access to current cases, criminal DB, Citizen DB .
6.An FR based Police Login.

Hence this application successfully bridges the gap between the people and the police force and leads to a more peaceful society.
